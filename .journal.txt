2015-01-23 18:17 @SQL learning to use hacking exploits is kinda fun but we have to be thorough.
So anyways to do sql injection you do your statement plus a statement that is always true.

2015-01-25 17:10 @Android so cool thing I did was go onto a site and download a jar, it had a ton of cool themes for this ide, so I grabbed solarized dark, LIKE ALWAYS, and then went on the editor selected file then import settings then selected the jar I downloaded.
It is really nice looking now.

2015-01-31 13:43 do not forget to use the simlink in order to switch the google drive icon color

2015-11-21 10:52 I installed a git repo in my home directory in order to keep track of all configurations for later.

2015-11-21 10:53 I installed irssi chat client.
It seems the way to use this is to join irc.freenode.net port 8001 and then you can join a place once connected

2015-11-21 12:05 Setting up Irssi is not actually that bad.
I am enjoying this setup for screen as well I think I will get used to this more and more. Hopefully I can make a better config eventually

2015-11-21 12:06 @test I think this creates a tag

2015-11-21 12:06 test

2015-11-21 12:10 I will be using this as my alternative source for collecting my thoughts

2015-11-21 12:10 @tips when using screen I have set the ctrl+arrow keys to switch between screens

2015-11-21 12:11 When using @irssi we connect using url and port number and then we connect to a port on the server where the chats are hosted

2015-11-21 21:04 in @latex we can stop a page break by setting the document class with the font to say notitlepage

2015-11-21 21:05 In order to use @latex for German we can use usepackage[german]{babel}

2015-11-22 16:23 For our @screen I set the escape character which was ctrl a to ctrl  which allows for better stuff I think.
But then to enter copying mode, which is the only wya to get to scroll up in screen, we have to do ctrl a plus escape char

2015-11-25 15:50 After messing around with vim and zsh configs I made came to the harsh realization that, while cool, none of this stuff really does anything for me unless I use it and for me to use it I need problems to solve with it so it may be useful to start programming some problems again.

015-11-29 14:52 Added a function to kill all detached @screen if screenrc starts giving us a hard time.
Just call killscreens to do it. It is a funciton in our zshrc

2015-11-29 15:03 I enabled @screen scrolling by defining a screllback buffer in the screenrc then doing some funky command for the scroll

2015-12-12 10:24 I installed a iTerm2 build from a git repo in order to get this borderless effect going on.
Will need to update some things in order to get this nice and working.

2015-12-12 16:00 so far today I have installed a lot of programs including...
amethyst, tmux, and some stuff i already forgot

2015-12-12 17:48 removed amethyst because while nice, it offered nothing more than what I have with spectacle and it wasn't that great

2015-12-13 17:05 So i reinstalled @amethyst don't judge me...
I have a problem

2015-12-13 17:07 Anyways @amethyst  some shit that I reconfigured: I have decided that all screen nonsense will be centered around using ctrl and command key plus another to do that nonsense.
Makes my life easier to remember. I focused the amethyst keys around vim in order to make it somewhat nice... H and L go counter/clockwise screen swapping. J and K swap the focus counter and clock.

2015-12-17 11:46 Installed a programmatical window manager named @mjolnir, should be fun to mess with but it allows me to do whatever I need to make this window system as awesome as possible

2015-12-25 15:37 today I messed around with mjolnir, I set the vim hotkeys and arrow keys for window organization and management.
I figured out that by using the right calls to cursor commands I can also switch windows WITH FRAMES to another space. Which is nice. Also I have a hotkey now that will toggle only one profile at a time which is baller
@mjolnir

2015-12-25 15:50 For @iterm remember to add the ability to hide a specific profile with a hotkey so you can have specific windows in specific places but also a window that is for general use.
This will be good for productivity and ease of use.
